# RAGMon Docs (Consolidated)

This directory houses the detailed technical documentation. High-level info and visuals live in the top-level `README.md`.

Contents:
- `implementation_details.md` – backend/frontend tech, config, presence model
- `development_plan.md` – phased plan and status
- `gotchas.md` – known issues and mitigations
- `quick_reference.md` – commands, ports, endpoints

Over time, we can merge these into a single `guide.md` if desired.
